# 📝 Express.js Notes

This repository contains my personal notes and hands-on practice while learning **Express.js** from [Thapa Technical](https://www.youtube.com/@ThapaTechnical) on YouTube.  
It’s a mix of concepts, code snippets, and mini-projects I built to strengthen my understanding.

## 🙋‍♂️ Why This Repo?

> I created this as a **learning-in-public** repo. While going through Thapa Technical’s tutorials, I made sure to write clean, organized code and keep track of what I understood.  
> It helps me revise faster and may help others who are just starting out with Express.js.
